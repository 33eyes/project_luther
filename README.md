**Question/need:**  
Is there a relationship between the Stack Overflow survey results for top programming languages and the Wikipedia page activity for those languages.

Can I predict the Stack Overflow 2018 survey results for the top programming languages by using Wikipedia page activity statistics for the top programming languages?

**Description of my sample of data:**  
Data sources:
 - Stack Overflow survey data
 - Web-scraped data from Wikipedia page stats pages for the top 10 most popular languages
 
**Characteristics of each entity:**  
Y = percent of language users (survey responders who use a particular language in the survey year)

Potential features:
 - number of edits on a Wikipedia page
 - the size/volume of the Wikipedia page
 - number or percent of minor edits
 - number or percent of IPs
 - number of 'protection' log events
 - Wikipedia page views
